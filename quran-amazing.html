<blockquote><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Calling the Qur'an amazing
is not something done only by Muslims, who have an appreciation for the
book and who are pleased with it; it has been labeled amazing by non-Muslims
as well. In fact, even people who hate Islam very much have still called
it amazing.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>One thing which surprises non_muslims
who are examining the book very closely is that the Qur'an does not appear
to them to be what they expected. What they assume is that they have an
old book which came fourteen centuries ago from the Arabian desert; and
they expect that the book should look something like that - an old book
from the desert. And then they find out that it does not resemble what
they expected at all. Additionally, one of the first things that some people
assume is that because it is an old book which comes from the desert, it
should talk about the desert. Well the Qur'an does talk about the desert
- some of its imagery describes the desert; but it also talks about the
sea - what it's like to be in a storm on the sea.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Some years ago, the story came to
us in Toronto about a man who was in the merchant marine and made his living
on the sea. A Muslim gave him a translation of the Qur'an to read. The
merchant marine knew nothing about the history of Islam but was interested
in reading the Qur'an. When he finished reading it, he brought it back
to the Muslim and asked, "This Muhammed, was he a sailor?" He was impressed
at how accurately the Qur'an describes a storm on a sea. When he was told,
"No as a matter of fact, Muhammed lived in the desert," that was enough
for him. He embraced Islam on the spot. He was so impressed with the Qur'an's
description because he had been in a storm on the sea, and he knew that
whoever had written that description had also been in a storm on the sea.
The description of "a wave, over it a wave, over it clouds" was not what
someone imagining a storm on a sea to be like would have written; rather,
it was written by someone who knew what a storm on the sea was like. This
is one example of how the Qur'an is not tied to a certain place and time.
Certainly, the scientific ideas expressed in it also do not seem to originate
from the desert fourteen centuries ago.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Many centuries before the onset of
Muhammed's Prophethood, there was a well-known theory of atomism advanced
by the Greek philosopher, Democritus. He and the people who came after
him assumed that matter consists of tiny, indestructible, indivisible particles
called atoms. The Arabs too, used to deal in the same concept; in fact,
the Arabic word dharrah commonly referred to the smallest particle known
to man. Now, modern science has discovered that this smallest unit of matter
(i.e., the atom, which has all of the same properties as its element) can
be split into its component parts. This is a new idea, a development of
the last century; yet, interestingly enough, this information had already
been documented in the Qur'an which states:</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>" He [i.e., Allah] is aware of an
atom's weight in the heavens and on the earth and even anything smaller
than that..."</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Undoubtedly, fourteen centuries ago
that statement would have looked unusual, even to an Arab. For him, the
dharrah was the smallest thing there was. Indeed, this is proof, that the
Qur'an is not outdated.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Another example of what one might
expect to find in an"old book" that touches upon the subject of health
or medicine is outdated remedies or cures. Various historical sources state
that the Prophet gave some advice about health and hygiene, yet most of
these pieces of advice are not contained in the Qur'an. At first glance,
to the non-Muslims this appears to be a negligent omission. They cannot
understand why Allah would not "include" such helpful information in the
Qur'an. Some Muslims attempt to explain this absence with the following
argument: "Although the Prophet's advice was sound and applicable to the
time in which he lived, Allah, in His infinite wisdom, knew that there
would come later medical and scientific advances which would make the Prophet's
advice appear outdated. When later discoveries occurred, people might say
that such information contradicted that which the Prophet had given. Thus,
since Allah would never allow any opportunity for the non-Muslims to claim
that the Qur'an contradicts itself or the teachings of the Prophet, He
only included in the Qur'an information and examples which could stand
the test of time."</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>However, when one examines the true
realities of the Qur'an in terms of its existence as a divine revelation,
the entire matter is quickly brought into its proper perspective, and the
error in such argumentation becomes clear and understandable. It must be
understood that the Qur'an is a divine revelation, and as such, all information
in it is of divine origin. Allah revealed the Qur'an from Himself. It is
the words of Allah, which existed before creation, and thus nothing can
be added, subtracted or altered. In essence, the Qur'an existed and was
complete before the creation of Prophet Muhammed, so it could not possibly
contain any of the Prophet's own words or advice. An inclusion of such
information would clearly contradict the purpose for which the Qur'an exists,
compromise its authority and render it inauthentic as a divine revelation.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Consequently, there was no "home
remedies" in the Qur'an which one could claim to be outdated; nor does
it contain any man's view about what is beneficial to health, what food
is best to eat, or what will cure this or that disease. In fact, the Qur'an
only mentions one item dealing with medical treatment, and it is not in
dispute by anyone. It states that in honey there is healing. And certainly,
I do not think that there is anyone who will argue with that!</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>If one assumes that the Qur'an is
the product of a man's mind, then one would expect it to reflect some of
what was going on in the mind of the man who "composed" it. In fact, certain
encyclopedias and various books clam that the Qur'an was the product of
hallucinations that Muhammed underwent. If these claims are true - if it
indeed originated from some psychological problems in Muhammed's mind -
then evidence of this would be apparent in the Qur'an. Is there such evidence?
In order to determine whether or not there is, one must first identify
what things would have been going on in his mind at that time and then
search for these thoughts and reflections in the Qur'an.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>It is common knowledge that Muhammad
had a very difficult life. All of his daughters died before him except
one, and he had a wife of several years who was dear and important to him,
who not only proceeded him in death at a very critical period of his life.
As a matter of fact, she must have been quite a woman because when the
first revelation came to him, he ran home to her afraid. Certainly, even
today one would have a hard time trying to find an Arab who would tell
you, "I was so afraid that I ran home to my wife." They just aren't that
way. Yet Muhammed felt comfortable enough with his wife to be able to do
that. That's how influential and strong woman she was. Although these examples
are only a few of the subjects that would have been on Muhammed's mind,
they are sufficient in intensity to prove my point. The Qur'an does not
mention any of these things - not the death of his children, not the death
of his beloved companion and wife, not his fear of the initial revelations,
which he so beautifully shared with his wife - nothing; yet, these topics
must have hurt him, bothered him, and caused him pain and grief during
periods of his psychological reflections, then these subjects, as well
as others, would be prevalent or at least mentioned throughout.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>A truly scientific approach to the
Qur'an is possible because the Qur'an offers something that is not offered
by other religious scriptures, in particular, and other religions, in general.
It is what scientists demand. Today there are many people who have ideas
and theories about how the universe works. These people are all over the
place, but the scientific community does not even bother to listen to them.
This is because within the last century the scientific community has demanded
a test of falsification. They say, "If you have theory, do not bother us
with it unless you bring with that theory a way for us to prove whether
you are wrong or not."</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Such a test was exactly why the scientific
community listened to Einstein towards the beginning of the century. He
came with a new theory and said, "I believe the universe works like this;
and here are three ways to prove whether I am wrong!". So the scientific
community subjected his theory to the tests, and within six years it passed
all three. Of course, this does not prove that he was great, but it proves
that he deserved to be listened to because he said, "This is my idea; and
if you want to try to prove me wrong, do this or try that." This is exactly
what the Qur'an has - falsification tests. Some are old (in that they have
already been proven true), and some still exist today. Basically it states,
"If this book is not what it claims to be, then all you have to do is this
or this or this to prove that it is false." Of course, in 1400 years no
one has been able to do "This or this or this, " and thus it is still considered
true and authentic. I suggest to you that the next time you get into dispute
with someone about Islam and he claims that he has the truth and that you
are in darkness, you leave all other arguments at first and make this suggestion.
Ask him, "Is there any falsification test in your religion? Is there anything
in your religion that would prove you are wrong if I could prove to you
that it exists - anything?" Well, I can promise right now that people will
not have anything - no test, no proof, nothing! This is because they do
not carry around the idea that they should not only present what they believe
but should also offer others a chance to prove they're wrong. However,
Islam does that. A perfect example of how Islam provides man with a chance
to verify it authenticity and "prove it wrong" occurs in the 4th chapter.
And quiet honestly, I was surprised when I first discovered this challenge.
It states:</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>"Do they not consider the Qur'an?
Had it been from any other than Allah, they would surely have found therein
much discrepancy."</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>This is a clear challenge to the
non-Muslim.Basically, it invites him to find a mistake. As a matter of
fact, the seriousness and difficulty of the challenge aside, the actual
presentation of such a challenge in the first place is not even in human
nature and is inconsistent with man's personality. One doesn't take an
exam in school after finishing the exam, write a note to the instructor
at the end saying, "This exam is perfect. There are no mistakes in it.
Find one if you can!". One just doesn't do that. The teacher would not
sleep until he found a mistake! And yet this is the way the Qur'an approaches
people. Another interesting attitude that exists in the Qur'an repeatedly
deals with its advice to the reader. The Qur'an informs that reader about
different facts and then gives the advice: "If you want to know more about
this or that, or if you doubt what is said, then you should ask those who
have knowledge." This too is a surprising attitude. It is not usual to
have a book that comes from someone without training in geography, botany,
biology, etc., who discusses these subjects and then advises the reader
to ask men of knowledge if he doubts anything.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Yet in every age there have been
Muslims who have followed the advice of the Qur'an and made surprising
discoveries. If one looks to the works of Muslim scientists if many centuries
ago, one will find them full of quotations from the Qur'an. These works
state that they did research in such a place, looking for something. And
they affirm that the reason they looked in such and such a place was that
the Qur'an pointed them in that direction. For example, the Qur'an mentions
man's origin and then tells the reader, "Research it!" It gives the reader
a hint where to look and then states that one should find out more about
it. This is the kind of thing that Muslims today largely seem to overlook
- but not always, as illustrated in the following example. A few years
ago, a group of men in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia collected all if the verses
in the Qur'an which discuss embryology - the growth of the human being
in the womb. They said, "Here is what the Qur'an says. Is it the truth?"
In essence, they took the advice of the Qur'an: "Ask the men who know."
They chose, as it happened, a non-Muslim who is a professor of embryology
at the University of Toronto. His name is Keith Moore, and he is the author
of textbooks on embryology - a world expert on the subject. They invited
him to Riyadh and said, "This is what the Qur'an says about your subject.
Is it true? What can you tell us?" While he was in Riyadh, they gave him
all of the help that he needed in translation and all of the cooperation
for which he asked. And he was so surprised at what he found that he changed
his textbooks. In fact, in the second edition of one of his books, called
Before we are born... in the second edition about the history of embryology,
he included some material that was not in the first edition because of
what he found in the Qur'an. Truly this illustrates that the Qur'an was
ahead of its time and that those who believe in the Qur'an know what other
people do not know.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>I had the pleasure of interviewing
Dr. Keith Moore for a television presentation, and we talked a great deal
about this - it was illustrated by slides and so on. He mentioned that
some of the things that the Qur'an states about the growth of the human
being were not known until thirty years ago. In fact, he said that one
item in particular - the Qur'an's description of the human being as a "leech-like
clot" ('alaqah) at one stage - was new to him; but when he checked on it,
he found that it was true, and so he added it to his book. He said, "I
never thought of that before," and he went to the zoology department and
asked for a picture of a leech. When he found that it looked just like
the human embryo, he decided to include both pictures in one of his textbooks.
Dr. Moore also wrote a book on clinical embryology, and when he presented
this information in Toronto, it caused quite a stir throughout Canada.
It was on the front pages of some of the newspapers across Canada, and
some of the headlines were quite funny. For instance, one headline read:
"SURPRISING THING FOUND IN ANCIENT BOOK!"! It seems obvious from this example
that people do not clearly understand what it is all about. As a matter
of fact, one newspaper reporter asked Professor Moore, "Don't you think
That maybe the Arabs might have known about these things - the description
of the embryo, its appearance and how it changes and grows? Maybe there
were not scientists, but maybe they did something crude dissections on
their own - carved up people and examined these things."</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>The professor immediately pointed
out to him that he [i.e., the reporter] had missed a very important point
- all of the slides of the embryo that had been shown and had been projected
in the film had come from pictures taken through a microscope. He said,
"It does not matter if someone had tried to discover embryology fourteen
centuries ago, they could not have seen it!". All of the descriptions in
the Qur'an of the appearance of the embryo are of the item when it is still
too small to see with the eye; therefore, one needs a microscope to see
it. Since such a device had only been around for little more than two hundred
years, Dr. Moore taunted, "Maybe fourteen centuries ago someone secretly
had a microscope and did this research, making no mistakes anywhere. Then
he somehow taught Muhammad and convinced him to put this information in
his book. Then he destroyed his equipment and kept it a secret forever.
Do you believe that? You really should not unless you bring some proof
because it is such a ridiculous theory." In fact, when he was asked "How
do you explain this information in the Qur'an?" Dr. Moore's reply was,
"It could only have been divinely revealed."!</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Although the aforementioned example
of man researching information contained in the Qur'an deals with a non-Muslim,
it is still valid because he is one of those who is knowledgeable in the
subject being researched. Had some layman claimed that what the Qur'an
says about embryology is true, then one would not necessarily have to accept
his word. However, because of the high position, respect, and esteem man
gives scholars, one naturally assumes that if they research a subject and
arrive at a conclusion based on that research, then the conclusion is valid.
One of Professor Moore's colleagues, Marshall Johnson, deals extensively
with geology at the University of Toronto.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>He became very interested in the
fact that the Qur'an's statements about embryology are accurate, and so
he asked Muslims to collect everything contained in the Qur'an which deals
with his specialty. Again people were very surprised at the findings. Since
there are a vast number subjects discussed in the Qur'an, it would certainly
require a large amount of time to exhaust each subject. It suffices for
the purpose of this discussion to state that the Qur'an makes very clear
and concise statements about various subjects while simultaneously advising
the reader to verify the authenticity of these statements with research
by scholars in those subjects. And as illustrated by the Qur'an has clearly
emerged authentic. Undoubtedly, there is an attitude in the Qur'an which
is not found anywhere else. It is interesting how when the Qur'an provides
information, it often tells the reader, "You did not know this before."
Indeed, there is no scripture that exists which makes that claim. All of
the other ancient writings and scriptures that people have, do give a lot
of information, but they always state where the information came from.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>For example, when the Bible discusses
ancient history, it states that this king lived here, this one fought in
a certain battle, another one had so may sons, etc. Yet it always stipulates
that if you want more information, then you should read the book of so
and so because that is where the information came from. In contrast to
this concept, the Qur'an provides the reader with information and states
that this information is something new. Of course, there always exists
the advice to research the information provided and verify its authenticity.
It is interesting that such a concept was never challenged by non-Muslims
fourteen centuries ago. Indeed, the Makkans who hated the Muslims, and
time and time again they heard such revelations claiming to bring new information;
yet, they never spoke up and said, "This is not new. We know where Muhammad
got this information. We learned this at school."</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>They could never challenge its authenticity
because it really was new! In concurrence with the advice given in the
Qur'an to research information (even if it is new), when 'Umar was caliph,
he chose a group of men and sent them to find the wall of Dhul-Qarnayn.
Before the Qur'anic revelation, the Arabs had never heard of such a wall,
but because the Qur'an described it, they were able to discover it. As
a matter of fact, it is now located in what is called Durbend in the Soviet
Union. It must be stressed here that the Qur'an is accurate about many,
many things, but accuracy does not necessarily mean that a book is a divine
revelation. In fact, accuracy is only one of the criteria for divine revelations.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>For instance, the telephone book
is accurate, but that does not mean that it is divinely revealed. The real
problem lies in that one must establish some proof of the source the Qur'an's
information. The emphasis is on the reader. One cannot simply deny the
Qur'an's authenticity without sufficient proof. If, indeed, one finds a
mistake, then he has the right to disqualify it. This is exactly what the
Qur'an encourages. Once a man came up to me after a lecture I delivered
in South Africa. He was very angry about what I had said, and so he claimed,
"I am going to go home tonight and find a mistake in the Qur'an." Of course,
I said, "Congratulations. That is the most intelligent thing that you have
said." Certainly, this is the approach Muslims need to take with those
who doubt the Qur'an's authenticity, because the Qur'an itself offers the
same challenge. An inevitably, after accepting it's challenge and discovering
that it is true, these people will come to believe it because they could
not disqualify it. In essence, the Qur'an earns their respect because they
themselves have had to verify its authenticity. An essential fact that
cannot be reiterated enough concerning the authenticity of the Qur'an is
that one's inability to explain a phenomenon himself does not require his
acceptance of the phenomenon's existence or another person's explanation
of it.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Specifically, just because one cannot
explain something does not mean that one has to accept someone else's explanation.
However, the person's refusal of other explanations reverts the burden
of proof back on himself to find a feasible answer. This general theory
applies to numerous concepts in life, but fits most wonderfully with the
Qur'anic challenge, for it creates a difficulty for one who says, "I do
not believe it." At the onset of refusal one immediately has an obligation
to find an explanation himself if he feels others' answers are inadequate.
In fact, in one particular Qur'anic verse which I have always seen mistranslated
into English, Allah mentions a man who heard the truth explained to him.
It states that he was derelict in his duty because after he heard the information,
he left without checking the verity of what he had heard. In other words,
one is guilty if he hears something and does not research it and check
to see whether it is true. One is supposed to process all information and
decide what is garbage to be thrown out and what is worthwhile information
to be kept and benefited from at a later date. One cannot just let it rattle
around in his head. It must be put in the proper categories and approached
from that point of view. For example, if the information is still speculatory,
then one must discern whether it's closer to being true or false. But if
all of the facts have been presented, then one must decide absolutely between
these two options. And even if one is not positive about the authenticity
of the information, he is still required to process all of the information
and make the admission that he just does not know for sure. Although this
last point appears to be futile, in actuality, it is beneficial to the
arrival at a positive conclusion at a later time in that it forces the
person to at least recognize, research and review the facts. This familiarity
with the information will give the person "the edge" when future discoveries
are made and additional information is presented. The important thing is
that one deals with the facts and does not simply discard them out of empathy
and disinterest.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>The real certainty about the truthfulness
of the Qur'an is evident in the confidence which is prevalent throughout
it; and this confidence comes from a different approach - "Exhausting the
Alternatives." In essence, the Qur'an states, "This book is a divine revelation;
if you do not believe that, then what is it?" In other words, the reader
is challenged to come up with some other explanation. Here is a book made
of paper and ink. Where did it come from? It says it is a divine revelation;
if it is not, then what is its source? The interesting fact is that no
one has with an explanation that works. In fact, all alternatives have
bee exhausted. As has been well established by non-Muslims, these alternatives
basically are reduces to two mutually exclusive schools of thought, insisting
on one or the other. On one hand, there exists a large group of people
who have researched the Qur'an for hundreds of years and who claim, "One
thing we know for sure - that man, Muhammad, thought he was a prophet.
He was crazy!" They are convinced that Muhammad (SAW) was fooled somehow.
Then on the other hand, there is another group which alleges, "Because
of this evidence, one thing we know for sure is that that man, Muhammad,
was a liar!" Ironically, these two groups never seem to get together without
contradicting. In fact, many references on Islam usually claim both theories.
They start out by saying that Muhammad (SAW) was crazy and then end by
saying that he was a liar. They never seem to realize that he could not
have been both!</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>For example, if one is deluded and
really thinks that he is a prophet, then he does not sit up late at night
planning, "How will I fool the people tomorrow so that they think I am
a prophet?" He truly believes that he is a prophet, and he trusts that
the answer will be given to him by revelation. As a matter of fact, a great
deal of the Qur'an came in answer to questions. Someone would ask Muhammad
(SAW) a question, and the revelation would come with the answer to it.
Certainly, if one is crazy and believes that an angel put words in his
ear, then when someone asks him a question, he thinks that the angel will
give him the answer. Because he is crazy, he really thinks that. He does
not tell someone to wait a short while and then run to his friends and
ask them, "Does anyone know the answer?" This type of behavior is characteristic
of one who does not believe that he is a prophet. What the non-Muslims
refuse to accept is that you cannot have it both ways. One can be deluded,
or he can be a liar. He can be either one or neither, but he certainly
cannot be both! The emphasis is on the fact that they are unquestionably
mutually exclusive personal traits.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>The following scenario is a good
example of the kind of circle that non-Muslims go around in constantly.
If you ask one of them, "What is the origin of the Qur'an?" He tells you
that it originated from the mind of a man who was crazy. Then you ask him,
"If it came from his head, then where did he get the information contained
in it? Certainly the Qur'an mentions many things with which the Arabs were
not familiar." So in order to explain the fact which you bring him, he
changes his position and says, "Well, maybe he was not crazy. Maybe some
foreigner brought him the information. So he lied and told people that
he was a prophet." At this point then you have to ask him, "If Muhammad
was a liar, then where did he get his confidence? Why did he behave as
though he really thought he was a prophet?" Finally backed into a corner,
like a cat he quickly lashes out with the first response that comes to
his mind. Forgetting that he has already exhausted that possibility, he
claims, "Well, maybe he wasn't a liar. He was probably crazy and really
thought that he was a prophet." And thus he begins the futile circle again.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>As has already been mentioned, there
is much information contained in the Qur'an whose source cannot be attributed
to anyone other than Allah. For example, who told Muhammad about the wall
of Dhul-Qarnayn - a place hundreds of miles to the north? Who told him
about embryology? When people assemble facts such as these, if they are
not willing to attribute their existence to a divine source, they automatically
resort to the assumption someone brought Muhammad the information and that
he used it to fool the people. However, this theory can easily be disproved
with one simple question: "If Muhammad was a liar, where did he get his
confidence? Why did he tell some people out right to their face what others
could never say?" Such confidence depends completely upon being convinced
that one has a true divine revelation. For example, the Prophet (SAW) had
an uncle by the name of Abu Lahab. This man hated Islam to such an extent
that he used to follow the Prophet around in order to discredit him. If
Abu Lahab saw the Prophet (SAW) speaking to a stranger, he would wait until
they parted and then would go to the stranger and ask him, "What did he
tell you? Did he say, 'Black.'? Well, it's white. Did he say, 'Morning.'?
Well, it's night." He faithfully said the exact opposite of whatever he
heard Muhammad (SAW) and the Muslims say. However, about ten years before
Abu Lahab died, a little chapter in the Qur'an was revealed to him. It
distinctly stated that he would go to the Fire (i.e., Hell). In other words,
it affirmed that he would never become a Muslim and would therefore be
condemned forever. For ten years all Abu Lahab had to do was say, "I heard
that it has been revealed to Muhammad that I will never change - that I
will never become a Muslim and will enter the Hellfire. Well I want to
become a Muslim now. How do you like that? What do you think of your divine
revelation now?" But he never did that. And yet, that is exactly the kind
of behavior one would have expected from him since he always sought to
contradict Islam. In essence, Muhammad (SAW) said, "You hate me and you
want to finish me? Here, say these words, and I am finished. Come on, say
them!" But Abu Lahab never said them. Ten years! And in all that time he
never accepted Islam or even became sympathetic to the Islamic cause. How
could Muhammad possibly have known for sure that Abu Lahab would fulfill
the Qur'anic revelation if he (i.e., Muhammad) was not truly the messenger
of Allah? How could he possibly have been so confident as to give someone
10 years to discredit his claim of Prophethood? The only answer is that
he was Allah's messenger; for in order to put forth suck a risky challenge,
one has to be entirely convinced that he has a divine revelation.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Another example of the confidence
which Muhammad (SAW) had in his own Prophethood and consequently in the
divine protection of himself and his message is when he left Makkah and
hid in a cave with Abu Bakr during their emigration to Madeenah. The two
clearly saw people coming to kill them, and Abu Bakr was afraid. Certainly,
if Muhammad (SAW) was a liar, a forger and one who was trying to fool the
people into believing that he was a prophet, one would have expected him
to say in such a circumstance to his friend, "Hey, Abu Bakr, see if you
can find a back way out of this cave." Or "Squat down in that corner over
there and keep quiet." Yet, in fact, what he said to Abu Bakr clearly illustrated
his confidence. He told him, "Relax! Allah is with us, and Allah will save
us!"</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Now, if one knows that he is fooling
the people, where does one get this kind of attitude? In fact, such a frame
of mind is not characteristic of a liar or a forger at all. So, as has
been previously mentioned, the non-Muslims go around and around in a circle,
searching for a way out - some way to explain the findings in the Qur'an
without attributing them to their proper source. On one hand, they tell
you on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, "The man was a liar," and on the other
hand, on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday they tell you, "He was crazy."
What they refuse to accept is that one cannot have it both ways; yet they
refuse to accept is that one cannot have it both ways; yet they need both
excuses to explain the information in the Qur'an.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>About seven years ago, I had a minister
over to my home. In the particular room which we were sitting there was
a Qur'an on the table, face down, and so the minister was not aware of
which book it was. In the midst of a discussion, I pointed to the Qur'an
and said, "I have confidence in that book." Looking at the Qur'an but not
knowing which book it was , he replied, "Well, I tell you, if that book
is not the Bible, it was written by a man!" In response to his statement,
I said, "Let me tell you something about what is in that book." And in
just three to four minutes I related to him a few things contained in the
Qur'an. After just those three or four minutes, he completely changed his
position and declared, "You are right. A man did not write that book. The
Devil wrote it!" Indeed, possessing such an attitude is very unfortunate
- for many reasons. For one thing, it is a very quick and cheap excuse.
It is an instant exit out of an uncomfortable situation. As a matter of
fact, there is a famous story in the Bible that mentions how one day some
of the Jews were witnesses when Jesus raised a man from the dead. The man
had been dead for four days, and when Jesus arrived, he simply said, "Get
up!" and the man arose and walked away. At such a sight, some of the Jews
who were watching said disbelievingly, "This is the Devil. The Devil helped
him!" Now this story is rehearsed often in churches all over the world,
and people cry big tears over it, saying, "Oh, if I had been there, I would
not have been as stupid as the Jews!" Yet ironically, these people do exactly
what the Jews did when in just three minutes you show them only a small
part of the Qur'an and all they can say is, "Oh, the Devil did it. The
devil wrote that book!". Because they are truly backed into a corner and
have no other viable answer, they resort to the quickest and cheapest excuse
available. Another Example of people's use of this weak stance can be found
in the Makkans' explanation of the source of Muhammed's message. They used
to say, "The devils bring Muhammad that Qur'an!" But just as with every
other suggestion made, the Qur'an gives the answer. One verse in particular
states:</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>"And they say, 'Surely he is possessed
[by jinn], 'but it [i.e., the Qur'an] is not except a reminder to the worlds."</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Thus it gives an argument in reply
to such a theory. In fact, there are many arguments in the Qur'an in reply
to the suggestion that devils brought Muhammad (SAW) his message. For example,
in the 26th chapter Allah clearly affirms:</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>"No evil ones have brought it [i.e.,
this revelation] down. It would neither be fitting for them, nor would
they be able. Indeed they have been removed far from hearing."</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>And in another place in the Qur'an,
Allah instructs us:</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>"So when you recite the Qur'an seek
refuge in Allah from Shaytaan, the rejected."</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Now is this how Satan writes a book?
He tells one, "Before you read my book, ask God to save you from me."?
This is very, very tricky. Indeed, a man could write something like this,
but would Satan do this? Many people clearly illustrate that they cannot
come to one conclusion on this subject. On one hand, they claim that Satan
would not do such a thing and that even if he could, God would not allow
him to; yet, on the other hand, they also believe that Satan is only that
much less than God. In essence they allege that the Devil can probably
do whatever God can do. And as a result, when they look at the Qur'an,
even as surprised as they are as to how amazing it is, they still insist,
"The Devil did this!" Thanks be to Allah, Muslims do not have that attitude.
Although Satan may have some abilities, they are a long way separated from
the abilities of Allah. And no Muslim is a Muslim unless he believes that.
It is common knowledge even among non-Muslims that the Devil can easily
make mistakes, and it would be expected that he would contradict himself
if and when he wrote a book. For indeed, the Qur'an states:</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>"Do they not consider the Qur'an?
Had it been from any other than Allah, they would surely have found therein
much discrepancy."</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>In conjunction with the excuses that
non-Muslims advance in futile attempts to justify unexplainable verses
in the Qur'an, there is another attack often rendered which seems to be
a combination of the theories that Muhammad (SAW) was crazy and a liar.
Basically, these people propose that Muhammad was insane, and as a result
of his delusion, he lied to and misled people. There is a name for this
in psychology. It is referred to as mythomania. It means simply that one
tells lies and then believes them. This is what the non-Muslims say Muhammad
(SAW) suffered from. But the only problem with this proposal is that one
suffering from mythomania absolutely cannot deal with facts, and yet the
whole Qur'an is based entirely upon facts. Everything contained in it can
be researched and established as true. Since facts are such a problem for
a mythomaniac, when a psychologist tries to treat one suffering from that
condition, he continually confronts him with facts. For example, if one
is mentally ill and claims, "I am the king of England," a psychologist
does not say to him "No you aren't. You are crazy!" He just does not do
that. Rather, he confronts him with facts and says, "O.K., you say you
are the king of England. So tell me where the queen is today. And where
is your prime minister? And where are your guards?" Now, when the man has
trouble trying to deal with these questions, he tries to make excuses,
saying Uh... the queen... she has gone to her mother's. Uh... the prime
minister... well he died." And eventually he is cured because he cannot
deal with the facts. If the psychologist continues confronting him with
enough facts, finally he faces the reality and says, "I guess I am not
the king of England." The Qur'an approaches everyone who reads it in very
much the same way a psychologist treats his mythomania patient. There is
a verse in the Qur'an which states:</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>"Oh mankind, there has come to you
an admonition [i.e., the Qur'an] from your Lord and a healing for what
is in the hearts - and guidance and mercy for the believers."</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>At first glance, this statement appears
vague, but the meaning of this verse is clear when one views it in light
of the aforementioned example. Basically, one is healed of his delusions
by reading the Qur'an. In essence, it is therapy. It literally cures deluded
people by confronting them with facts. A prevalent attitude throughout
the Qur'an is one which says, "Oh mankind, you say such and such about
this; but what about such and such? How can you say this when you know
that?" And so forth. It forces one to consider what is relevant and what
matters while simultaneously healing one of the delusions that the facts
presented to mankind by Allah can easily be explained away with flimsy
theories and excuses. It is this very sort of thing - confronting people
with facts - that had captured the attention of many non-Muslims. In fact,
there exists a very interesting reference concerning this subject in the
New Catholic Encyclopedia.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>In an article under the subject of
the Qur'an, the Catholic Church states, "Over the centuries, many theories
have been offered as to the origin of the Qur'an... Today no sensible man
accepts any of these theories."!! Now here is the age-old Catholic Church,
which has been around for so many centuries, denying these futile attempts
to explain away the Qur'an. Indeed, the Qur'an is a problem for the Catholic
Church. It states that it is revelation, so they study it. Certainly, they
would love to find proof that it is not, but they cannot. They cannot find
a viable explanation. But at least they are honest in their research and
do not accept the first unsubstantiated interpretation which comes along.
The Church states that in fourteen centuries it has not yet been presented
a sensible explanation. At least it admits that the Qur'an is not an easy
subject to dismiss. Certainly, other people are much less honest. They
quickly say, "Oh, the Qur'an came from here. The Qur'an came from there."
And they do not even examine the credibility of what they are stating most
of the time. Of course, such a statement by the Catholic Church leaves
the everyday Christian in some difficulty. It just may be that he has his
own ideas as to the origin of the Qur'an, but as a single member of the
Church, he cannot really act upon his own theory. Such an action would
be contrary to the obedience, allegiance and loyalty which the Church demands.
By virtue of his membership, he must accept what the Catholic Church declares
without question and establish its teachings as part of his everyday routine.
So, in essence, if the Catholic Church as a whole is saying, "Do not listen
to these unconfirmed reports about the Qur'an," then what can be said about
the Islamic point of view? Even non-Muslims are admitting that there is
something to the Qur'an - something that has to be acknowledged - then
why are people so stubborn and defensive and hostile when Muslims advance
the very same theory? This is certainly something for those with mind a
to contemplate - something to ponder for those of understanding!</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Recently, the leading intellectual
in the Catholic Church - a man by the name of Hans - studied the Qur'an
and gave his opinion of what he had read. This man has been around for
some time, and he is highly respected in the Catholic Church, and after
careful scrutiny, he reported his findings, concluding, "God has spoken
to man through the man, Muhammad." Again this is a conclusion arrived at
by a non-Muslim source - the very leading intellectual of the Catholic
Church himself! I do not think that the Pope agrees with him, but nonetheless,
the opinion of such a noted, repute public figure must carry some weight
in defense of the Muslim position. He must be applauded for facing the
reality that the Qur'an is not something which can be easily pushed aside
and that, in fact God is the source of these words. As is evident from
the aforementioned information, all of the possibilities have been exhausted,
so the chance of finding another possibility of dismissing the Qur'an is
nonexistent. For if the book is not a revelation, then it is a deception;
and if it is a deception, one must ask, "What is its origin" And where
does it deceive us?" Indeed, the true answers to these questions shed light
on the Qur'an's authenticity and silence the bitter unsubstantiated claims
of the unbelievers. Certainly, if people are going to insist that the Qur'an
is a deception, then they must bring forth evidence to support such a claim.
The burden of proof is on them, not us! One is never supposed to advance
a theory without sufficient corroborating facts; so I say to them, "Show
me one deception! Show me where the Qur'an deceives me! Show me, otherwise,
don't say that it is a deception!" An interesting characteristic of the
Qur'an is how it deals with surprising phenomena which relate not only
to the past but to modern times as well. In essence, the Qur'an is not
and old problem. It is still a problem even today - a problem to the non-Muslims
that is. For everyday, every week, every year brings more and more evidence
that the Qur'an is a force to be contended with - that its authenticity
is no longer to be challenged! For example, one verse in the Qur'an reads;</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>"Do not the unbelievers see that
the heavens and the earth were joined together, then We clove them asunder,
and made from water every living thing? Will they not then believe?"</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Ironically, this very information
is exactly what they awarded the 1973 Noble Prize for - to a couple of
unbelievers. The Qur'an reveals the origin of the universe - how it began
from one piece - and mankind continues to verify this revelation, even
up to now. Additionally, the fact that all life originated from water would
not have been an easy thing to convince people of fourteen centuries ago.
Indeed, if 1400 years ago you had stood in the desert and told someone,
"All of this, you see (pointing to yourself), is made up of mostly water,"
no one would have believed you. Proof of that was not available until the
invention of the microscope. They had to wait to find out that cytoplasm,
the basic substance of the cell, is made-up of 80% water. Nonetheless,
the evidence did come, and once again the Qur'an stood the test of time.
In reference to the falsification tests mentioned earlier, it is interesting
to note that they, too, relate to both the past and the present. Some of
them were used as illustrations of Allah's omnipotence and knowledge, while
others continue to stand as challenges to the present day. An example of
the former is the statement made in the Qur'an about Abu Lahab. It clearly
illustrates that Allah, the Knower of the Unseen, knew that Abu Lahab would
never change his ways and accept Islam. Thus Allah dictated that he would
be condemned to the Hellfire forever. Such a chapter was both an illustration
of Allah's divine wisdom and a warning to those who were like Abu Lahab.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>An interesting example of the latter
type of falsification tests contained in the Qur'an is the verse which
mentions the relationship between the Muslims and the Jews. The verse is
careful not to narrow its scope to the relationship between individual
members of each religion, but rather, it summarizes the relationship between
the two groups of people as a whole. In essence, the Qur'an states that
the Christians will always treat the Muslims better than the Jews will
treat the Muslims. Indeed, the full impact of such a statement can only
be felt after careful consideration of the real meaning of such a verse.
It is true that many Christians and many Jews have become Muslims, but
as a whole, the Jewish community is to be viewed as an avid enemy of Islam.
Additionally, very few people realize what such an open declaration in
the Qur'an invites. In essence, it is an easy chance for the Jews to prove
that the Qur'an is false - that it is not a divine revelation. All they
have to do is organize themselves, treat the Muslims nicely for a few years
and then say, "Now what does your holy book say about who are your best
friends in the world - the Jews or the Christians? Look what we Jews have
done for you!" That is all they have to do to disprove the Qur'an's authenticity,
yet they have not done it in 1400 years. But, as always, the offer still
stands open!</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>All of the examples so far given
concerning the I various angles from which one can approach the | Qur'an
have undoubtedly been subjective in nature; I however there does exist
another angle, among others, which is objective and whose basis is mathematical.
It is surprising how authentic the Qur'an becomes when one assembles what
might be referred to as a list of good guesses. Mathematically, it can
be explained using guessing and prediction examples. For instance, if a
person has two choices (i.e., one is right, and one is wrong), and he closes
his eyes and makes a choice, then half of the time (i.e., one time out
of two) he will be right. Basically, he has a one in two chance, for he
could pick the wrong choice, or he could pick the right choice. Now if
the same person has two situations like that (i.e., he could be right or
wrong about situation number one, and he could be right or wrong about
situation number two), and he closes his eyes and guesses, then he will
only be right one fourth of the time (i.e., one time out of four). He now
has a one in four chance because now there are three ways for him to be
wrong and only one way for him to be right. In simple terms, he could make
the wrong choice in situation number one and then make the wrong choice
in situation number two; OR he could make the wrong choice in situation
number one and then make the right choice in situation number two; OR he
could make the right choice in situation number one and then make the wrong
choice in situation number two; OR he could make the right choice in situation
number one and then make the right choice in situation number two. Of course,
the(only instance in which he could be totally right is the last scenario
where he could guess correctly in both situations. The odds of his guessing
completely correctly have become greater because the number of situations
for him to guess in have increased; and the mathematical equation representing
such a scenario is 1/2 x 1/2 (i.e., one time out of two for the first situation
multiplied by one time out of two for the second situation).</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Continuing on with the example, if
the same person now has three situations in which to make blind guesses,
then he will only be right one eighth of the time (i.e., one time out of
eight or 1/2 X 1/2 X 1/2). Again, the odds of choosing the correct choice
in all three situations have decreased his chances of being completely
correct to only one time in eight. It must be understood that as the number
of situations increase, the chances of being right decrease, for the two
phenomena are inversely proportional.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Now applying this example to the
situations in the Qur'an, if one draws up a list of all of the subjects
about which the Qur'an has made correct statements, it becomes very clear
that it is highly unlikely that they were all just correct blind guesses.
Indeed, the subjects discussed in the Qur'an are numerous, and thus the
odds of someone just making lucky guesses about all of them become practically
nil. If there are a million ways for the Qur'an to be wrong, yet each time
it is right, then it is unlikely that someone was guessing. The following
three examples of subjects about which the Qur'an has made correct statements
collectively illustrate how the Qur'an continues to beat the odds.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>In the 16th chapter the Qur'an mentions
that the female bee leaves its home to gather food.l2 Now, a person might
guess on that, saying, "The bee that you see flying around - it could be
male, or it could be female. I think I will guess female." Certainly, he
has a one in two chance of being right. So it happens that the Qur'an is
right. But it also happens that was not what most people believed at the
time when the Qur'an was revealed. Can you tell the difference between
a male and a female bee? Well, it takes a specialist to do that, but it
has been discovered that the male bee never leaves his home to gather food.
However, in Shakespeare's play, Henry the Fourth, some of the characters
discuss bees and mention that the bees are soldiers and have a king. That
is what people thought in Shakespeare's time - that the bees that one sees
flying around are male bees and that they go home and answer to a king.
However, that is not true at all. The fact is that they are females, and
they answer to a queen. Yet it took modern scientific investigations in
the last 300 years to discover that this is the case.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>So, back to the list of good guesses,
concerning the topic of bees, the Qur'an had a 50/50 chance of being right,
and the odds were one in two.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>In addition to the subject of bees,
the Qur'an also discusses the sun and the manner in which it travels through
space. Again, a person can guess on that subject. When the sun moves through
space, there are two options: it can travel just as a stone would travel
if one threw it, or it can move of its own accord. The Qur'an states the
latter - that it moves as a result of its own motion.'3 To do such, the
Qur'an uses a form of the word sabaha to describe the sun's movement through
space. In order to properly provide the reader with a comprehensive understanding
of the implications of this Arabic verb, the following example is given.
If a man is in water and the verb sabaha is applied in reference to his
movement, it can be understood that he is swimming, moving of his own accord
and not as a result of a direct force applied to him. Thus when this verb
is used in reference to the sun's movement through space, it in no way
implies that the sun is flying uncontrollably through space as a result
of being hurled or the like. It simply means that the sun is turning and
rotating as it travels. Now, this is what the Qur'an affirms, but was it
an easy thing to discover? Can any common man tell that the sun is turning?
Only in modern times was the equipment made available to project the image
of the sun onto a tabletop so that one could look at it without being blinded.
And through this process it was discovered that not only are there three
spots on the sun but that these spots move once every 25 days. This movement
is referred to as the rotation of the sun around its axis and conclusively
proves that, as the Qur'an stated 1400 years ago, the sun does, indeed
turn as it travels through space.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>And returning once again to the subject
of good guess, the odds of guessing correctly about both subjects - the
sex of bees and the movement of the sun - are one in four!</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Seeing as back fourteen centuries
ago people probably did not understand much about time zones, the Quran's
statements about this subject are considerably surprising. The concept
that one family is having breakfast as the sun comes up while another family
is enjoying the brisk night air is truly something to be marveled at, even
in modern time. Indeed, fourteen centuries ago, a man could not travel
more than thirty miles in one day, and thus it took him literally months
to travel from India to Morocco, for example. And probably , when he was
having supper in Morocco, he thought to himself, "Back home in India they
are having supper right now." This is because he did not realize that,
in the process of traveling, he moved across a time zone. Yet, because
it is the words of Allah, the All-Knowing, the Qur'an recognizes and acknowledges
such a phenomenon. In an interesting verse it states that when history
comes to an end and the Day of Judgment arrives, it will all occurring
an instant; and this very instant will catch some people in the daytime
and some people at night. This clearly illustrates Allah's divine wisdom
and His previous knowledge of the existence of time zones, even though
such a discovery was non-existent back fourteen centuries ago. Certainly,
this phenomenon is not something which is obvious to one's eyes or a result
of one's experience, and this fact, in itself, suffices as proof of the
Qur'ans authenticity.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Returning one final time to the subject
of good guesses for the purpose of the present example, the odds that someone
guessed correctly about all three of the aforementioned subjects - the
sex of bees, the movement of the sun and the existence of time zones -
are one in eight!</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Certainly, one could continue on
and on with this example, drawing up longer and longer list of good guesses;
and of course, the odds would become higher and higher with each increase
of subjects about which one could guess. But what no one can deny is the
following; the odds that Mohammed an illiterate, guessed correctly about
thousands and thousands of subjects, never once making a mistake, are so
high that any theory of his authorship of the Qur'an must be completely
dismissed - even by the most hostile enemies of Islam!</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Indeed, the Qur'an expects this kind
of challenge. Undoubtedly, if one said to someone upon entering a foreign
land, "I know your father. I have met him," probably the man from that
land would doubt the newcomer's word, saying, "You have just come here.
How could you know my father?" As a result, he would question him, "Tell
me, is my father tall, short, dark, fair? What is he like?" Of course,
if the visitor continued answering all of the questions correctly, the
skeptic would have no choice but to say, "I guess you do know my father.
I don't know how you know him, but I guess you do!" The situation is the
same with the Qur'an. It states that it originates from the One who created
everything. So everyone has the right to say, "Convince me! If the author
of this book really originated life and everything in the heavens and on
the earth, then He should know about this, about that, and so on." And
inevitably, after researching the Qur'an, everyone will discover the same
truths. Additionally, we all know something for sure: we do not all have
to be experts to verify what the Qur'an affirms. One's iman (faith) grows
as one continues to check and confirm the truths contained in the Qur'an.
And one is supposed to do so all of his life.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>May God (Allah) guide everyone close
to the truth.</font></font><br>
